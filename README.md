# GenAI MIDI Module

The generative AI MIDI module lets you add generative AI capability to electronic musical instruments over a MIDI interface. This system runs on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. 

This program doesn't make any sounds, it just sends generated MIDI messages over a Raspberry Pi's serial port.

## Making

### Prepare Raspberry Pi OS

1. Flash an SD card with "Raspberry Pi OS Lite 64-bit" using the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/). These instructions work with Kernel 6.1, Debian 12 Bookworm.

2. Make sure that SSH is enabled and that you know the username and password. The username should be `pi`.

3. SSH into the Pi and clone this repository.
