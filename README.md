# GenAI MIDI Module

The generative AI MIDI module lets you add generative AI capability to electronic musical instruments over a MIDI interface. This system runs on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. 

This program doesn't make any sounds, it just sends generated MIDI messages over a Raspberry Pi's serial port.
